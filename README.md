This is a website for people who are interested in purchasing personalised cakes but would like to get more information, a quote and view previous cakes that were made.

The site allows users to request a quote, showcasing the different options they have when ordering the cake, such as size and flavour, what we recommend a user select based off experience is also provided.

## UX
### Strategy
What are the main goals of this site?
* To provide people with information on the cake business and lure them to request a quote.
* To provide a clean and simple site which allows users to easily navigate around.
* Get more customers/ leads, with the end goal to result in more cake purchases.
#### User Stories
##### First Time Visitor Goals
* I want to be able to see the different cake options available and base my quote request off that.
* As a First Time Visitor, I would like to be able to see the different types of cakes that were previously made so I can see if the designer can make the cake I’ve been dreaming of.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
##### Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if they have created new cake flavours and different designs, or even other desserts.
* As a returning user, I would like to find the best means of contacting the company, even for other queries, which might not necessarily be about a quote.
* I would like to see if their cake designing portfolio has increased, and, if the delivery area for cakes has expanded.


### Scope
Which features, based on info from strategy plane, do we want to include in the site?
* Image gallery
* Form for quotes
* Modal for quote form
### Structure
How is the information on the site structured and is it logically grouped?
Across the entire site the pages are all created with the same skeleton structure. The top would be the nav bar, with the company name and the three different pages. The middle varies between pages, so the first ‘Home’ page includes an image with a sentence or two, and then a reviews section. The gallery page has images and the quotes page has a form for people to fill in. The bottom of all pages includes a footer for all pages which includes the social media links for the company.
Can the user understand and easily navigate through the system when using it for the first time?
There are only three pages and the information on each page has been kept to a minimal to not bombard users with too much text.
### Skeleton 
The website is divided into the three sections, however along the way I did change the ‘quote’ page title to ‘our process’. For the gallery page, I did remove the carousal and layout the images side by side with text overlay. 
- Landing Page:<a href="assets/docs/wireframes/landingpage.pdf" target="_blank" >  Home</a>
- Gallery:<a href="assets/docs/wireframes/gallerypage.pdf" target="_blank" >  Gallery</a>
- Quote:<a href="assets/docs/wireframes/quotepage.pdf" target="_blank" >  Quote</a>
### Surface
As most of the cakes that was made had similar colours, such as light pink, white and purple with some being bright colours, I decided to make the site match this.
Design
#### Colour Scheme
The main colours which are used are:
* shades of purple (6c6d93 and 432371)
* shades of orange (FAAE7B and FEF5EF)
* shades of pink (B47978 and AC7277)
#### Typography
* The Montserrat font is the main paragraph text font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
* For the company title in the nav bar and for most heading text, dancing script font was used with Sans Serif used as the fall back.
#### Imagery
* The images that I chose for the site was very important. As the main selling point for cakes as a first-time buyer is how the cakes look, I had to make sure the main landing page image can show what our capabilities are. 
* For the gallery section, a variety of different cake styles had to be chosen, and the images had to be bright and vibrant.


## Features
### Existing Features
For most of those who wish to purchase a cake for a special occasion, they already have a basic outline of what type of cake they want. When they search the web, the main purpose of this is to find bakers that can bring their ideas to life and making sure it fits with their budget.
#### Navbar
* On the navbar the logo and the menu items on a desktop are on opposite ends, when users click on the logo or the ‘home’ button, they would be redirected to the home page.
* On a mobile or tablet, the navbar is then collapsed to show the toggler icon which expands below the logo, at the centre displayer the other pages.
#### Home
* On the home page there is an image of cupcakes surrounding a large cake, this welcomes the users and showcases the cake. Over the images there is the company’s motto.
* Upon scrolling down, there is a an about ‘us’ section
#### Our Process
* In the first container, there are 3 cards, under the title ‘build your cake’
* Below the cards is a ‘quote’ button, which opens a modal form which they can fill out using the information given above from the 3 cards.
* There is also a section titled ‘reviews’, which showcases previous customers experience, an image created by AI was used for each customer. 
#### Gallery
* This page shows 9 images, each of the same height, in the desktop version you can see three in one row, whereas in the mobile view you can see one cake at a time.
* Upon hovering over the cake images, an overlay was added with a short description of the cakes. The description is in the structure of the card information previous stated in the ‘our process’ pages, so, it would have the cake size, flavour and design.
#### Contact Us
* The page welcomes users by having contact information and a form for any enquiries
* There is also a map on the left-hand side of the form
#### Footer
* The footer provides an email address for people to contact and social media links, using font awesome icons
### Features Left to Implement
* Include an online chatbot for people to ask simple questions and receive a response instantly – however, this is beyond my current knowledge
* Allowing some sort of calculator, which when a specific cake size or flavour is selected, pricing for this would appear
* Have more image animation
* Improve the look on the ‘Build your cake’ section

## Testing
W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were utilized to approve each page of the task to guarantee there were no syntax errors in the project.
- W3C Markup Validator - <a href="assets/docs/validation/w3chtmlvalidator.pdf.pdf" target="_blank" >  Results</a>
- W3C CSS Validator - <a href="assets/docs/validation/w3cssvalidator.pdf" target="_blank" >  Results</a>

Throughout the project there was some errors, such as the nav-bar, I did want the logo to be on the left hands-side, but the rest of the menu on the right-hand side. To fix this I had to use media queries.
