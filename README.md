### Structure
How is the information on the site structured and is it logically grouped?
Across the entire site the pages are all created with the same skeleton structure. The top would be the nav bar, with the company name and the three different pages. The middle varies between pages, so the first ‘Home’ page includes an image with a sentence or two, and then a reviews section. The gallery page has images and the quotes page has a form for people to fill in. The bottom of all pages includes a footer for all pages which includes the social media links for the company.
Can the user understand and easily navigate through the system when using it for the first time?
There are only three pages and the information on each page has been kept to a minimal to not bombard users with too much text.
